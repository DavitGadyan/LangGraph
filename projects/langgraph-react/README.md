ðŸš€ **LangGraph ReACT Agent**

A simple ReACT-style agent built with LangGraph that interleaves **Reasoning** (R) and **Action** (Act) steps to handle user queries. At each turn, the agent:

1. **Thinks** â€“ Generates internal reasoning about the task.  
2. **Acts** â€“ Calls out to tools or functions via `ToolNode`.  
3. **Observes** â€“ Captures the toolâ€™s output as new context.  
4. **Answers** â€“ Uses both reasoning and observations to produce the final reply.

### ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **python-dotenv** â€“ Loads environment variables (e.g. API keys).  
- **LangChain Hub** (`hwchase17/react`) â€“ Provides the ReACT prompt template.  
- **LangChain Agents** â€“ `create_react_agent` to wire up the R/A loop.  
- **TavilySearchResults** â€“ A community search tool for web queries (returns top result).  
- **Custom `triple` tool** â€“ Example tool that multiplies a number by 3.  
- **ChatOpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`)** â€“ The underlying LLM for reasoning and responses.

**Graph Explanation:**

- **start**: Entry point of the agent.  
- **agent_reason**: The agent generates its internal reasoning (R) based on the user input or tool results.  
- **act**: If the agent decides an external action is needed, it invokes a tool (Act).  
- **end**: The agent terminates when no further actions are required.
