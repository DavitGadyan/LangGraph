üöÄ **Agentic-RAG: Crypto Insights Chatbot**

A smart, AI-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that extracts the latest news and price data for five major cryptocurrencies (XRP, BTC, ADA, ETH, SOL) from CoinDesk, stores embeddings in an in-memory vectorstore, and answers user questions via a LangGraph workflow with query rewriting and semantic search.

### üîß Workflows Included

#### üì∞ `data_ingestion`

- Scrapes CoinDesk for:
  - General crypto headlines: `https://www.coindesk.com/`
  - Individual price pages:  
    - XRP: `https://www.coindesk.com/price/xrp`  
    - BTC: `https://www.coindesk.com/price/btc`  
    - ADA: `https://www.coindesk.com/price/ada`  
    - ETH: `https://www.coindesk.com/price/eth`  
    - SOL: `https://www.coindesk.com/price/sol`  
- Parses and extracts articles, timestamps, and price data.
- Generates embeddings with **OpenAI GPT-4o**.
- Stores embeddings in an **in-memory vectorstore** for fast semantic retrieval.

#### ü§ñ `agentic_rag`

- **Step 1:** Receive user question.
- **Step 2:** Rewrite the question for better semantic matching.
- **Step 3:** Use vectorstore to retrieve the most relevant documents.
- **Step 4:** Generate a final, coherent answer with **GPT-4o**.
- **Step 5:** Stream updates through LangGraph nodes:  
  - `generate_query_or_respond` ‚Üí  
  - conditional `retrieve` (via **ToolNode**) ‚Üí  
  - `grade_documents` ‚Üí  
  - `rewrite_question` ‚Üí  
  - `generate_answer` ‚Üí END.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Hello! How can I help you today?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

When considering crypto assets with potential for high returns, it‚Äôs important to remember that high return often comes with high risk. The crypto market is volatile, and prices can swing dramatically. However, some assets are frequently discussed for their potential due to technology, adoption, or unique features. Here are a few categories and examples:

### 1. **Established Cryptocurrencies**
- **Bitcoin (BTC):** The original cryptocurrency, often seen as a ‚Äústore of value.‚Äù Its scarcity and widespread adoption make it a long-term contender.
- **Ethereum (ETH):** Powers the largest smart contract platform, with many decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects built on it. The upcoming upgrades (like Ethereum 2.0) could further boost its value.

### 2. **Layer 1 & Layer 2 Solutions**
- **Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA):** Compete with Ethereum by offering faster and cheaper transactions. If they gain more adoption, their value could rise.
- **Polygon (MATIC):** A Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, helping to reduce fees and increase transaction speed.

### 3. **DeFi Tokens**
- **Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), and Compound (COMP):** These power decentralized finance protocols, which are growing rapidly as alternatives to traditional banking.

### 4. **Web3 & Infrastructure**
- **Chainlink (LINK):** Provides real-world data to blockchains, essential for many DeFi applications.
- **The Graph (GRT):** Indexes blockchain data, making it easier for dApps to access information.

### 5. **Emerging & Speculative Coins**
- **Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP):** Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum, gaining traction for scaling.
- **AI and Gaming Tokens:** Projects like Render (RNDR), Immutable (IMX), and others in the AI or gaming space are gaining attention for their innovative use cases.

---

## **Why These Assets?**
- **Technology & Utility:** Coins with strong technology and real-world use cases tend to have more staying power.
- **Adoption:** The more users and developers a platform has, the more valuable its token can become.
- **Ecosystem Growth:** Projects that attract other projects (like Ethereum or Solana) can see exponential growth.
- **Scarcity:** Limited supply (like Bitcoin) can drive up price if demand increases.

---

## **Risks**
- **Volatility:** Prices can drop as quickly as they rise.
- **Regulation:** Governments may introduce rules that impact certain assets.
- **Competition:** Newer, better technologies can overtake existing projects.

---

**Always do your own research (DYOR) and consider your risk tolerance before investing.** If you want the latest insights or specific project analysis, let me know! I can fetch recent blog posts or expert opinions on promising crypto assets.
Certainly! Here‚Äôs an improved version of the question:

What do recent articles say about the current and future prices of XRP?
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The articles suggest that the price of XRP should rise. This indicates a positive outlook or expectation for XRP's future value. No specific reasons or detailed analysis are provided in the context.
